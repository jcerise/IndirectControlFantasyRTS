##Indirect Control Fantasy RTS

Fun name, I know. This is an attempt to recreate a game similar in nature to [Majesty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majesty:_The_Fantasy_Kingdom_Sim), which used an indirect control scheme to build a fantasy kingdom.

This is also an attempt to learn [Ebiten](https://ebiten.org/).

###Build Instructions
1. Clone repo into GOPATH
2. `go run main.go`
3. Be disappointed at the lack of anything remotely resembling a game
